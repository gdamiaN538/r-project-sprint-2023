Much of the work is done by a small number of volunteers and there is a need to grow the contributor community.\nThis sprint will bring together novice and experienced contributors, to work alongside members of the R Core Team. Participants will work collaboratively on contributions to base R. The tasks will be prepared in the run-up to the event, but may include:\n\nReviewing, analysing and fixing bugs reported on R’s Bugzilla.\nContributing to message translations via Weblate.\nWork on new developments such as this short project proposed by core developer Paul Murrell: Adding Alpha Masks to the Quartz Graphics Device."

The table below shows the type of knowledge/skills we expect participants to have\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSkills most will have\nSkills some will have\n\n\n\n\nWriting R functions\nProgramming in C\n\n\nDebugging R functions\nKnowledge of S3/S4 classes and methods\n\n\nWriting R help files\nExpertise in statistical methods in stats, splines\n\n\nUsing git/Subversion\nAble to build R from source\n\n\n\nOther specialist skills e.g. expertise in building Windows/MacOS GUIs or fluency in language with a low percentage of translated messages on Weblate, would of course be welcome!\nIt will help if you have some experience in contributing to base R, but novice contributors will be mentored in the run-up to the event, so they are prepared.\nWe are also keen to foster a diverse community of contributors. If you are a member of the R-Ladies, MiR, RainbowR, AfricaR, ArabR, AsiaR, or LatinR communities, or otherwise identify as part of an underrepresented group among R contributors, then we especially encourage you to self-nominate! To ensure a welcoming environment, we have a code of conduct in place."

This ensures backward compatibility and prevents disruptions to existing code.\n\n\nIt is hard to pick one algorithm over the multitude of available unequal probability sampling algorithms.

Specific targets include:\n\nHindi: Finish translating R and C messages in the base package, so that Hindi might be added to next minor release of R (~500 strings). Ensure translations are reviewed and do not fail Weblate checks.\nJapanese: Add translations for the parallel package (~50 strings across R and C code) and translations for C messages in the utils package (~50 strings). Currently these components are completely untranslated.\nSpanish: Finish translating R messages in the base package (~400 strings) and review translations marked as “needs editing”.\nBrazilian Portuguese: Finish translating R messages in the tools package (~100 strings) and review translations marked as “needs editing”.\nArabic: Add translations for the Windows GUI (~250 strings).\n\nAs time allows, translators can work towards further targets as appropriate, contributing translations, reviewing each other’s translations and making sure the strings pass Weblate’s checks (e.g. no trailing white space).\nIn addition, translators will work across languages on the following tasks:\n\nUpdating the R Development Guide to cover contributing translations via Weblate. There is overlap here with the Weblate Improvements project.\nDrafting guidelines for translation teams, building on the current Translations wiki. These may later be incorporated into the R Dev Guide.\nGuidelines/tooling to support the use of glossaries, building on past work such as the “R French Dictionary”."

For example, although the pdf() device used above supports both types of masks, Cairo-based graphics devices, e.g., png(type=\"cairo\"), only support alpha masks. If you try maskTest(lmask) on a Cairo graphics device you will get a warning and the mask with have no effect.\nIn R version 4.3, support for luminance masks was added to the Quartz graphics device in R (quartz() on MacOS). Unfortunately, in a reverse of the Cairo graphics device problem, Quartz graphics only supports luminance masks so we have not implemented alpha masks on the quartz() device. If you try maskTest(amask) on a quartz() device, you will get a warning and the mask with have no effect."

    "section": "Proposed solution",
    "text": "Proposed solution\nThe implementation of luminance masks for the quartz() device involves creating a greyscale bitmap image and drawing the mask shapes onto that. This happens in the C function QuartzCreateMask() (in R/src/library/grDevices/src/devQuartz.c). The Quartz function CGContextClipToMask() uses that greyscale image to clip output.\nThe proposal is that an alpha mask could be implemented by creating an RGBA bitmap image (instead of a greyscale image) for drawing the mask shapes onto and then converting that image to a greyscale one based on the alpha channel of the RGBA image. Once we have a greyscale image from the alpha mask, we can proceed as before.\nThe dev-&gt;capabilities() of the quartz() device would also need updating."

Potential additions represented at the sprint: Spanish, Brazilian Portuguese, Nepali.\nAdd support for Right-to-Left languages, see the Apple docs.\nBegin to add Arabic translations.\n\nTasks 2 and 3 depend on a minimal viable product from task 1 (e.g. an initial set up may rely on some manual steps that could be scripted/automated later). Translators could contribute to other projects until this is ready.\nTask 4 can be worked on independently of tasks 1 to 3, but task 5 is dependent on both task 1 and 4.

    "section": "Problem statement",
    "text": "Problem statement\nThe current implementation of dendrapply is included at the bottom of this section. This implementation has two main issues.\nThe most notable of these is the recursive application of functions to the dendrogram nodes. This leads to poor performance on deeply nested dendrograms, as well as the potential for stack overflow errors on machines with limited resources. This is detailed in ?dendrapply and in the warning in ?dendrogram.\nAdditionally, tree traversal can be achieved in a number of ways. The current implementation uses a pre-order traversal, which is not always the most intuitive application of functions to a tree structure. This means that, for each triple 2 &lt;- 1 -&gt; 3, the function is applied first to node 1, then to 2, then to 3. Ideally, users would be able to choose between a post-order or a pre-order traversal. Post-order traversals guarantee that the function is applied to all children of a node before applying to the parent, allowing for certain analyses that rely on propagating results up a tree. There is currently no easy way to achieve this in R.\nIn summary, the priorities to rectify are (in order of importance):\n\nRemove recursion in dendrapply\nAdd an optional argument to allow for different tree traversals in function application\n\nThese must be achieved while preserving all the current functionality of dendrapply, and without decreasing the current performance.\nCurrent implementation:\n\ndendrapply &lt;- function(X, FUN, ...)\n{\n    ## Purpose: \"dendrogram\" recursive apply {to each node}\n    ## ----------------------------------------------------------------------\n    ## Author: Martin Maechler, Date: 26 Jun 2004, 22:43\n    FUN &lt;- match.fun(FUN)\n    if( !inherits(X, \"dendrogram\") ) stop(\"'X' is not a dendrogram\")\n\n    ## Node apply recursively:\n    Napply &lt;- function(d) {\n    r &lt;- FUN(d, ...)\n    if(!is.leaf(d)) {\n        if(!is.list(r)) r &lt;- as.list(r) # fixing unsafe FUN()s\n        if(length(r) &lt; (n &lt;- length(d))) r[seq_len(n)] &lt;- vector(\"list\", n)\n        ## and overwrite recursively, possibly keeping \"attr\"\n        r[] &lt;- lapply(d, Napply)\n        }\n    r\n    }\n    Napply(X)\n}"

    "title": "Dendrapply Refactor",
    "section": "Proposed solution",
    "text": "Proposed solution\nA full description follows, but people that are interested can read my initial writeup for more details on the problem, attempted solutions, and current status. Feel free to skip that link and just read the following section instead.\nA prototype solution has been implemented and submitted to Bugzilla. This solution moves the R implementation into C. The short description of the proposed method is to create a linked list in C holding the SEXP pointers for each node of the tree. Then, we apply the function given to each node of the linked list, and then merge the SEXP objects back into the original topology. This can be further optimized by merging nodes on the fly to limit linked list space and reduce PROTECT stack usage. This also allows for different tree traversal strategies with minimal effort, as different tree traversals can be achieved by varying how nodes are added to the linked list.\nThe current solution has one key issue resulting in a two problems. This implementation uses VECTOR_ELT rather than the more general [[ and [[&lt;- operations to get/set values. This allows for low PROTECT stack usage and high performance, but it also means that nodes discard their class values when passed to the function. This can be solved naively by just reclassing nodes as dendrogram, but unfortunately this causes issues in the case where nodes have multiple classes (ex. a node where class(node ) == c('dendrogram', 'myOtherClass')). This also runs into problems in the case where a non-standard [[ method is implemented. In the interest of backwards compatibility, these problems should be rectified.\nThere are a few options for fixing this issue. The first is to work entirely in R, removing the C implementation. This would work in theory by using a list structure to hold nodes, but the linked-list structure in C gives a substantial boost in performance over R by using pointers instead of copying each object. This may not be a big deal; I haven’t tested it yet.\nAnother possible option is to use the alternative vector-based dendrogram indexing ( dend[[c(1,1)]] is equivalent to dend[[1]][[1]] ) to build a list of targets first, then apply the function to each. This may solve the potential R-implementation memory issues, but could also require initializing a huge vector. Dealing with the topology of the dendrogram would also be challenging.\nAnother potential fix is to use the [[ method by building an R expression in C and then calling it, similar to how lapply is implemented (see do_lapply() in src/main/apply.c for reference). This implementation was tested and worked successfully, but the result was significantly slower than the R version (roughly half speed, likely due to PROTECT stack issues mentioned below). Maybe a code refactor could solve the slowdowns and produce a better result.\nThe last potential fix I’ve identified is to use precious multi-sets for protection rather than PROTECT. One of the big problems of applying functions in C is that the result of the function application at each node needs to be protected. This isn’t an issue for post-order traversals, since we can always just add the result as a child of the parent node (which auto-protects it if the parent is already protected). However, for the current implementation, a potentially large source of slow-downs is the work-arounds implemented to solve PROTECT stack issues. Using MSets could simplify this and improve runtime, but there isn’t a lot of documentations on how to use them (and their use for this kind of problem is explicitly discouraged in some places)."

This function minimizes the amount of operations within the applied function, meaning that the vast majority of the differences in time will be due to the implementation of dendrapply, not the runtime of f.\nAdditional testing should be done to verify that the following work as expected:\n\nEnsure speed of new application is at least as fast as stats::dendrapply\nEnsure all examples in ?dendrapply work as expected\nEnsure all tests in dendextend work correctly to test a large set of currently used applications of dendrapply\nEnsure that nodes with multiple classes retain their class attribute after running dendrapply\nEnsure that special uses of [[ work as expected\nEnsure that recursive dendrapply calls work as expected (ex. dendrapply(dend, \\(x) dendrapply(x, someOtherFunction)))\nEnsure all examples in the R build testing work as expected, paying special attention to the following weird case:\n\n&gt; D &lt;- as.dendrogram(hclust(dist(cbind(setNames(c(0,1,4), LETTERS[1:3])))))\n&gt; dendrapply(D, labels)\n[[1]]\n[1] \"C\"\n\n[[2]]\n[[2]][[1]]\n[1] \"A\"\n\n[[2]][[2]]\n[1] \"B\"\n\n[[3]]\n[1] \"C\"\nImplementation should also be made to ensure that the default parameters are fully backwards compatible. In the case of post-order traversal, this is currently being achieved by defining the function as dendrapply(X, FUN, ..., how=c('pre.order', 'post.order')) so that the default is always equivalent to stats::dendrapply.\nFinally, testing should be added to the R source tests. The current testing suite for dendrapply is very sparse; edge cases like multi-classed dendrogram objects should be added to ensure code works as expected in the future."
