    "text": "Problem statement\nNot all graphics devices support masks. For those that do, not all devices support both alpha masks and luminance masks. For example, although the pdf() device used above supports both types of masks, Cairo-based graphics devices, e.g., png(type=\"cairo\"), only support alpha masks. If you try maskTest(lmask) on a Cairo graphics device you will get a warning and the mask with have no effect.\nIn R version 4.3, support for luminance masks was added to the Quartz graphics device in R (quartz() on MacOS). Unfortunately, in a reverse of the Cairo graphics device problem, Quartz graphics only supports luminance masks so we have not implemented alpha masks on the quartz() device. If you try maskTest(amask) on a quartz() device, you will get a warning and the mask with have no effect."

    "section": "Proposed solution",
    "text": "Proposed solution\nThe implementation of luminance masks for the quartz() device involves creating a greyscale bitmap image and drawing the mask shapes onto that. This happens in the C function QuartzCreateMask() (in R/src/library/grDevices/src/devQuartz.c). The Quartz function CGContextClipToMask() uses that greyscale image to clip output.\nThe proposal is that an alpha mask could be implemented by creating an RGBA bitmap image (instead of a greyscale image) for drawing the mask shapes onto and then converting that image to a greyscale one based on the alpha channel of the RGBA image. Once we have a greyscale image from the alpha mask, we can proceed as before.\nThe dev-&gt;capabilities() of the quartz() device would also need updating."

Teaching to novices I usually encourage my students to look in the documentation and, in particular, to check the examples for to learn the basic usage of functions. However, I often find example sections that are too complex for them or don’t include an example for the simplest usage of the function.\nFor instance, the example section of cut() starts with:\nZ &lt;- stats::rnorm(10000)\ntable(cut(Z, breaks = -6:6))\nThis requires the user to know what the rnorm() and table() functions do before the first usage to cut(). The result also doesn’t directly help understanding the output and behaviour of cut(). A better starting example could be something very simple like\ncut(0:10, breaks = 5)"

    "section": "Problem statement",
    "text": "Problem statement\nThe current implementation of dendrapply is included at the bottom of this section. This implementation has two main issues.\nThe most notable of these is the recursive application of functions to the dendrogram nodes. This leads to poor performance on deeply nested dendrograms, as well as the potential for stack overflow errors on machines with limited resources. This is detailed in ?dendrapply and in the warning in ?dendrogram.\nAdditionally, tree traversal can be achieved in a number of ways. The current implementation uses a pre-order traversal, which is not always the most intuitive application of functions to a tree structure. This means that, for each triple 2 &lt;- 1 -&gt; 3, the function is applied first to node 1, then to 2, then to 3. Ideally, users would be able to choose between a post-order or a pre-order traversal. Post-order traversals guarantee that the function is applied to all children of a node before applying to the parent, allowing for certain analyses that rely on propagating results up a tree. There is currently no easy way to achieve this in R.\nIn summary, the priorities to rectify are (in order of importance):\n\nRemove recursion in dendrapply\nAdd an optional argument to allow for different tree traversals in function application\n\nThese must be achieved while preserving all the current functionality of dendrapply, and without decreasing the current performance.\nCurrent implementation:\n\ndendrapply &lt;- function(X, FUN, ...)\n{\n    ## Purpose: \"dendrogram\" recursive apply {to each node}\n    ## ----------------------------------------------------------------------\n    ## Author: Martin Maechler, Date: 26 Jun 2004, 22:43\n    FUN &lt;- match.fun(FUN)\n    if( !inherits(X, \"dendrogram\") ) stop(\"'X' is not a dendrogram\")\n\n    ## Node apply recursively:\n    Napply &lt;- function(d) {\n    r &lt;- FUN(d, ...)\n    if(!is.leaf(d)) {\n        if(!is.list(r)) r &lt;- as.list(r) # fixing unsafe FUN()s\n        if(length(r) &lt; (n &lt;- length(d))) r[seq_len(n)] &lt;- vector(\"list\", n)\n        ## and overwrite recursively, possibly keeping \"attr\"\n        r[] &lt;- lapply(d, Napply)\n        }\n    r\n    }\n    Napply(X)\n}"

    "section": "Proposed solution",
    "text": "Proposed solution\nA full description follows, but people that are interested can read my initial writeup for more details on the problem, attempted solutions, and current status. Feel free to skip that link and just read the following section instead.\nA prototype solution has been implemented and submitted to Bugzilla. This solution moves the R implementation into C. The short description of the proposed method is to create a linked list in C holding the SEXP pointers for each node of the tree. Then, we apply the function given to each node of the linked list, and then merge the SEXP objects back into the original topology. This can be further optimized by merging nodes on the fly to limit linked list space and reduce PROTECT stack usage. This also allows for different tree traversal strategies with minimal effort, as different tree traversals can be achieved by varying how nodes are added to the linked list.\nThe current solution has one key issue resulting in a two problems. This implementation uses VECTOR_ELT rather than the more general [[ and [[&lt;- operations to get/set values. This allows for low PROTECT stack usage and high performance, but it also means that nodes discard their class values when passed to the function. This can be solved naively by just reclassing nodes as dendrogram, but unfortunately this causes issues in the case where nodes have multiple classes (ex. a node where class(node ) == c('dendrogram', 'myOtherClass')). This also runs into problems in the case where a non-standard [[ method is implemented. In the interest of backwards compatibility, these problems should be rectified.\nThere are a few options for fixing this issue. The first is to work entirely in R, removing the C implementation. This would work in theory by using a list structure to hold nodes, but the linked-list structure in C gives a substantial boost in performance over R by using pointers instead of copying each object. This may not be a big deal; I haven’t tested it yet.\nAnother possible option is to use the alternative vector-based dendrogram indexing ( dend[[c(1,1)]] is equivalent to dend[[1]][[1]] ) to build a list of targets first, then apply the function to each. This may solve the potential R-implementation memory issues, but could also require initializing a huge vector. Dealing with the topology of the dendrogram would also be challenging.\nAnother potential fix is to use the [[ method by building an R expression in C and then calling it, similar to how lapply is implemented (see do_lapply() in src/main/apply.c for reference). This implementation was tested and worked successfully, but the result was significantly slower than the R version (roughly half speed, likely due to PROTECT stack issues mentioned below). Maybe a code refactor could solve the slowdowns and produce a better result.\nThe last potential fix I’ve identified is to use precious multi-sets for protection rather than PROTECT. One of the big problems of applying functions in C is that the result of the function application at each node needs to be protected. This isn’t an issue for post-order traversals, since we can always just add the result as a child of the parent node (which auto-protects it if the parent is already protected). However, for the current implementation, a potentially large source of slow-downs is the work-arounds implemented to solve PROTECT stack issues. Using MSets could simplify this and improve runtime, but there isn’t a lot of documentations on how to use them (and their use for this kind of problem is explicitly discouraged in some places)."

This function minimizes the amount of operations within the applied function, meaning that the vast majority of the differences in time will be due to the implementation of dendrapply, not the runtime of f.\nAdditional testing should be done to verify that the following work as expected:\n\nEnsure speed of new application is at least as fast as stats::dendrapply\nEnsure all examples in ?dendrapply work as expected\nEnsure all tests in dendextend work correctly to test a large set of currently used applications of dendrapply\nEnsure that nodes with multiple classes retain their class attribute after running dendrapply\nEnsure that special uses of [[ work as expected\nEnsure that recursive dendrapply calls work as expected (ex. dendrapply(dend, \\(x) dendrapply(x, someOtherFunction)))\nEnsure all examples in the R build testing work as expected, paying special attention to the following weird case:\n\n&gt; D &lt;- as.dendrogram(hclust(dist(cbind(setNames(c(0,1,4), LETTERS[1:3])))))\n&gt; dendrapply(D, labels)\n[[1]]\n[1] \"C\"\n\n[[2]]\n[[2]][[1]]\n[1] \"A\"\n\n[[2]][[2]]\n[1] \"B\"\n\n[[3]]\n[1] \"C\"\nImplementation should also be made to ensure that the default parameters are fully backwards compatible. In the case of post-order traversal, this is currently being achieved by defining the function as dendrapply(X, FUN, ..., how=c('pre.order', 'post.order')) so that the default is always equivalent to stats::dendrapply.\nFinally, testing should be added to the R source tests. The current testing suite for dendrapply is very sparse; edge cases like multi-classed dendrogram objects should be added to ensure code works as expected in the future."

If you are a member of the R-Ladies, MiR, RainbowR, AfricaR, ArabR, AsiaR, or LatinR communities, or otherwise identify as part of an underrepresented group among R contributors, then we especially encourage you to self-nominate! To ensure a welcoming environment, we have a code of conduct in place."
