In complex cases, this may require creating a Docker image so that the whole environment is reproducible.\n\ndiscuss\n\nDiscuss what the appropriate behaviour of the code should be, or discuss a proposal to clarify the way forward.

Participants will work collaboratively on contributions to base R. The tasks will be prepared in the run-up to the event, but may include:\n\nReviewing, analysing and fixing bugs reported on R’s Bugzilla.\nContributing to message translations via Weblate.\nWork on new developments such as this short project proposed by core developer Paul Murrell: Adding Alpha Masks to the Quartz Graphics Device."

If you are a member of the R-Ladies, MiR, RainbowR, AfricaR, ArabR, AsiaR, or LatinR communities, or otherwise identify as part of an underrepresented group among R contributors, then we especially encourage you to self-nominate!

    "title": "Adding Alpha Masks to the Quartz Graphics Device",
    "section": "Proposed solution",
    "text": "Proposed solution\nThe implementation of luminance masks for the quartz() device involves creating a greyscale bitmap image and drawing the mask shapes onto that. This happens in the C function QuartzCreateMask() (in R/src/library/grDevices/src/devQuartz.c). The Quartz function CGContextClipToMask() uses that greyscale image to clip output.\nThe proposal is that an alpha mask could be implemented by creating an RGBA bitmap image (instead of a greyscale image) for drawing the mask shapes onto and then converting that image to a greyscale one based on the alpha channel of the RGBA image. Once we have a greyscale image from the alpha mask, we can proceed as before.\nThe dev-&gt;capabilities() of the quartz() device would also need updating."
